description = "Makes it possible to turn off most hud elements and outlines. 
These elements can be turned off separately: 
    - HUD (equipment, character portraits, health bars, stamina, overcharge etc.) 
    - Objectives (objective markers, banner and button prompts) 
    - Outlines (players, items, objects) 
    - Crosshair 
    - Ping  
    - Feedback (damage indicators, special kills and assists) 
    - Weapon model and hands 
Keybinds (not set by default) can be used to toggle elements one by one. 
Note that Ping and Feedback are toggled together when doing it this way.
 
How to use: 
Set keybinds in the mod options menu or use the checkboxes to toggle specific elements of the HUD. ";
