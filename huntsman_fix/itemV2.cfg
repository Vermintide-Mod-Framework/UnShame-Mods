title = "Huntsman Ult Fix (BuffExtension Fix)";
description = "This is a fix for the BuffExtension.
It fixes an old bug where the huntsman's horrible ult screen effect sometimes reactivates on hits if you switched weapons during the ult.
https://github.com/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/UnShame-Mods/commit/cf14a6b6cff21ef46369d6a580d4ede7a73a6d1b
Also includes a fix for the black fading effect persisting when using Huntsman's and Shade's ability while it is already active.  
https://github.com/Vermintide-Mod-Framework/UnShame-Mods/commit/f6616de3ad6f4a4d23933fd494642d724362e20f

It potentially fixes other bugs, present and future, that have to do with:
1. Buffs that activate on certain events.
2. Buffs that add a continuous screen effect and have a limited amount of possible stacks.";
